# HangyaAI-AntAI
An AI which work like an ant colony.
This is a project what I made in python to act and work like an ant colony.
The project built using pygame, every ant on the screen(600x600) is a pixel.
The AI works really simple, first the program places 1000 ant into the map,
then the ants move random directions and if one ant find a food it will trace a line called "feromone".
The other ants will follow that line.
The colony base is where the ants first placed.

Simple colony:
